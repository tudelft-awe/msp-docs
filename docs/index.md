# MkDocs Material Template
This is an MkDocs Material Template repository. It enables a useful set of extensions and plugins by default, and contains a Makefile that uses Docker to serve the documentation locally, and a Github workflow to publish the documentation on Github Pages by default.

To use, invoke:

```bash
make
```

This will publish the documentation at [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000/) by default, and watch for any changes to the documentation source files. Other targets in the `Makefile` include:

- `serve` (default) — Serves the documentation and watches for changes.
- `build` — Builds the documentation.
- `gh-deploy` — Deploys the documentation to Github Pages.
- `version` — Prints the version information.
- `help` — Prints help information.

## Customization
Change the fields in `mkdocs.yml` to suit your needs. In particular, change the `site_name`, `site_description` and `site_author`, and the URLs for `repo_url` (where the Github button links to) and `edit_uri` (where the pages can be edited).


## Adding Plugins
A few plugins have been enabled by default. To add additional plugins, add them to the `plugins` section of `mkdocs.yml` ([documentation](https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/configuration/#plugins)) and the required packages to `mkdocs_requirements.txt`. The plugins are automatically installed into the Docker image.


## Updating MkDocs Material
To change the version of MkDocs Material, change the version number in `mkdocs_requirements.txt`. The version is automatically updated in the Docker image as well.


## Serving on a Different Port
By default the documentation is served on port `8000`. To change the default temporarily, invoke `make` like this:

```bash
make PORT=8080
```

To permanently chang the port, change the value of `PORT` in the `Makefile`.

```Makefile
PORT ?= 8080
```


## Makefile on Top-Level
If you want to have the `Makefile` on the top level instead of in the `docs/` directory, move it to the top level directory and change the `ROOT` variable in the `Makefile` to:

```Makefile
ROOT ?= $(DIR)/.
```

!!! note ""
    Note the slash-dot `/.` at the end. The `ROOT` directory points to the directory with `mkdocs.yml` relative to the `Makefile`.


## Different branch
The template assumes your default branch is named `main` or `master`. If it's named something else, change the `on push branches` in `.github/workflows/docs.yml`:

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - my-docs-branch
```
